# Techunlock-Cybersecurity-Training

TechUnlock Cybersecurity Training Program

In partnership with the World Bank and the Federal Ministry of Education, TechUnlock launched a transformative cybersecurity training program designed to equip the next generation of professionals with industry-relevant skills. As the lead cybersecurity instructor, I had the honor of training over 400 students, guiding them through a comprehensive curriculum that bridged the gap between academic knowledge and real-world industry demands.

The program emphasized hands-on learning in key areas such as ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, incident response, and threat intelligence. Beyond technical expertise, students were prepared for the job market with tailored sessions on resume building, interview coaching, and professional development.

A major highlight of this initiative was the success of several students in earning globally recognized cybersecurity certifications such as Certified in Cybersecurity and Cisco CyberOps!
. These certifications not only validated their technical skills but also opened doors to high-demand job opportunities in leading tech firms and government agencies.

Under my guidance, students gained the confidence and expertise needed to excel in cybersecurity roles, making this program a key contributor to workforce development and a model for addressing the critical need for skilled cybersecurity professionals nationwide.
